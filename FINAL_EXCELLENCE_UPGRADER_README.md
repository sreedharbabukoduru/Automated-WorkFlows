```

### Custom Configuration
```python
from final_excellence_upgrader import FinalExcellenceUpgrader

# Custom configuration
upgrader = FinalExcellenceUpgrader(
    workflows_dir="custom_workflows",
    backup_dir="custom_backup",
    max_workers=8
)

# Run upgrade
results = upgrader.upgrade_all_workflows()
upgrader.generate_comprehensive_report(results)
```

## üìã Quality Scoring System

The upgrader uses a comprehensive 100-point scoring system:

### Scoring Criteria
- **Hardcoded URLs** (-15 points): Replaces with environment variables
- **Sensitive Data** (-20 points): Removes or replaces with placeholders
- **Error Handling** (-10 points): Adds error handling nodes
- **Documentation** (-5 points): Adds workflow documentation
- **Naming Issues** (-8 points): Fixes naming conventions
- **Structure Issues** (-5 points): Optimizes workflow structure
- **Duplicate Names** (-3 points each): Fixes duplicate node names

### Quality Categories
- **Excellent**: 90-100 points
- **Good**: 75-89 points
- **Fair**: 60-74 points
- **Poor**: 0-59 points

## üîß Features in Detail

### 1. Workflow Analysis
```python
# Analyze workflow quality
quality = upgrader.calculate_workflow_quality(workflow_data)
print(f"Score: {quality.score}/100")
print(f"Category: {quality.category}")
print(f"Issues: {quality.issues}")
```

### 2. Issue Detection
- **Hardcoded URLs**: Finds and replaces hardcoded URLs
- **Sensitive Data**: Detects API keys, tokens, passwords
- **Naming Issues**: Identifies poor naming conventions
- **Structure Problems**: Detects workflow organization issues

### 3. Automatic Fixes
- **URL Replacement**: Converts hardcoded URLs to environment variables
- **Data Sanitization**: Replaces sensitive data with placeholders
- **Error Handling**: Adds comprehensive error handling nodes
- **Documentation**: Creates detailed workflow documentation
- **Naming Fixes**: Ensures unique, descriptive node names

### 4. Parallel Processing
- **Multi-threading**: Processes multiple workflows simultaneously
- **Configurable Workers**: Adjustable thread count for optimal performance
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of individual workflow failures
